Lesson 1: Intro, charts
========================

Basic intro, course syllabus
------------------------------------------------------------
 In the first lesson we'll talk about what is to be a skipper in general, our course syllabus, what is DS course certificate and what is DS course in Ireland itself, what to expect.
 Every lesson will consist of three parts: check & discuss a previous lesson homework, new part of theory and practice part (do some exercises, knots, etc) 

Ok, imagine that you're skipper — what does it mean?
----------------------------------------------------
 What is the skipper's main function onboard?

 Responsible for all things happen onboard. Keep in mind this. Especially when something asking to go outside cockpit in rough weather. Or tells you "come on, there is a plenty of time before storm will arrive us, let's stay one more day in this beautiful bay".

 So you need wide knowledge, sharp mind and much experience to stay in touch with current conditions (from team emotional state to weather conditions). For example, somewhere in our main textbook there is a list of preparation for rough weather — and there is a remark what you should clean chart table (remain only current chart) and prepare a small towel near chart table so the navigator can dry his face to prevent drips on the charts, when he comes from the deck. This example shows that you should be one step ahead reality =)
